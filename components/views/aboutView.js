          <p>Outside of work, I love spending my free time playing sports!</p>
          <p>
            Ever since my first year of college I&apos;ve been hooked on rock
            climbing, so now I climb at CRG Fenway after work twice a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over Covid, I replaced rock climbing with running. I just reached my
            season goal of 4 miles averaging under 8 minutes per mile!
          </p>
          <p>
            I also come from a big tennis family, so I&apos;m always down to
            play a set on the weekends. Hit me up if you&apos;ve got a racquet!

          <p>Cooking is another big part of my life!</p>
          <p>
            I love cooking Asian styled dishes with my own twist on them. Some
            of my favorites to both cook and eat include steamed taro and pork
            with black bean sauce, stir fried rice cake, and braised beef noodle
            soup.

            One day, I&apos;d love to open a restaurant to have the chance to
            share both my culture and food with others!

            Nowadays, I love scrolling through Musescore and sightreading any
